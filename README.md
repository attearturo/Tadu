# Tadu
Tadu Web is a notetaking app developed for learning Django.
> Note App building with Django and MySQL for server.


## Folder Structure

After creation, your project should look like this:

```
TestServerProdoc/
  .git/
  Tadu/
    tadu/
    posts/
    db.sqlite3
    manage.py
  UI/
    editable.xd
    Calendar Mode.png
    List Mode.png
    Done Tasks.png
    New Tasks.png
    Selected.png
    Task Detail.png
  README.md
```

For the project to build, **those files must exist with exact filenames**.

## Available Scripts

First at all, you will need to run the server. In this case I used XAMPP for build a local server with MySQL. Then you may open the server on your localhost with:

### `$ python manage.py runserver`

Open the server in the development mode.<br>
Check [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:48000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
